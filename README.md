The dataset titled "CO2 Emissions in Canada" contain information on various vehicle models and their corresponding CO2 (carbon dioxide emissions), fuel consumption metrics in Canada. The dataset consists of 7,385 entries and is structured with the following 12 attributes:

- Make: The brand of the vehicle.
- Model: The specific model of the vehicle.
- Vehicle Class: The category of the vehicle (e.g., SUV, compact).
- Engine Size (L): The volume of the engine in liters.
- Cylinders: The number of cylinders in the vehicle's engine.
- Transmission: The type of transmission (e.g., automatic, manual).
- Fuel Type: The type of fuel the vehicle uses (e.g., gasoline, diesel).
- Fuel Consumption City (L/100 km): The fuel consumption in urban areas measured in liters per 100 kilometers.
- Fuel Consumption Hwy (L/100 km): The fuel consumption on highways measured in liters per 100 kilometers.
- Fuel Consumption Comb (L/100 km): The combined fuel consumption (city and highway) measured in liters per 100 kilometers.
- Fuel Consumption Comb (mpg): The combined fuel consumption (city and highway) measured in miles per gallon.
- CO2 Emissions(g/km): The CO2 emissions of the vehicle measured in grams per kilometer.

This dataset can provide insights into the environmental impact of different vehicle types, and consumers in making informed decisions regarding vehicle purchases and usage based on environmental considerations. It also serves as a resource for studying trends in vehicle emissions, evaluating the efficiency of different engine types and fuel systems, and advancing initiatives towards reducing vehicular emissions. â€‹
